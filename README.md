# 🚀 Elevator Simulation Project

A Python-based interactive simulation of a multi-building elevator system designed for performance, clarity, and extensibility.

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a neighborhood of buildings, each with multiple floors and elevators. Users can interact with floors to call elevators, track their movement and wait time, and enjoy visual and audio feedback. The system aims to demonstrate efficient elevator dispatching and clean architecture using object-oriented Python and Pygame.

---

## 🎯 Features

* 🏢 **Multiple Buildings** — Supports multiple buildings with their own canvas and elevator configuration.
* ⬆️ **Elevator Call System** — Click to call an elevator to a specific floor.
* 🕒 **Live Timer** — Countdown on each floor showing time until elevator arrival.
* 🧠 **Optimized Dispatching** — Elevators are assigned to calls based on earliest possible arrival time.
* 🖼️ **Graphical Interface** — Brick-style background, shadowed buttons, animated elevators.
* 🔊 **Sound Effects** — Arrival sound (`ding.mp3`) plays when the elevator reaches a floor.
* ⚙️ **Custom Config** — Easily adjust the number of floors, elevators, travel speed, and UI dimensions.

## 🖥️ User Interface

* Each floor is rendered with a unique surface and a **7-pixel black line** at the top.
* Elevator buttons are circular and show the floor number (or `"E"` for entrance).
* Button color turns **green** when an elevator is called.
* A **white-background timer** appears beside the button while waiting.
* Elevator motion is smooth, moving at **0.5 seconds per floor**.
* Elevator image: `elv.png`
* Sound file: `ding.mp3`

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dovi-Amiram/Elevator-Project-Mefathim.git
   cd Elevator-Project-Mefathim
   ```

2. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure most parameters in `config.py`, including:

* Number of buildings, floors, elevators (`BUILDINGS`)
* Floor and elevator dimensions
* Elevator speed (`TRAVEL_TIME_PER_FLOOR`)
* Fonts, colors, button styles

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Add down/up buttons per floor
* Simulate elevator capacity and waiting queues
* Improve allocation algorithm to prioritize direction
* Add keyboard-accessible elevator control panel

## 🧠 Educational Use

This project was created for educational purposes at **Mefathim**, a CS training bootcamp. It demonstrates:

* Object-oriented design
* Event-driven programming with Pygame
* Design patterns (factory, singleton)
* Real-world system simulation
