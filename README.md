# Elevator Project

## Overview

This project involves designing and building an efficient elevator system using Python. The goal is to create a user-friendly simulation of a building with elevators, floors, and elevator controls.

## Features

- Display of the building, including floors, elevators, and elevator controls.
- Elevator call buttons on each floor.
- A countdown timer indicating the time until the elevator arrives.
- Optimized elevator algorithm to minimize waiting time.
- Configurable number of floors and elevators.
- Smooth animation of elevator movement at 0.5 seconds per floor.
- Sound notification upon elevator arrival.

## User Interface

- Each floor is displayed with a brick background.
- A 7-pixel black line separates each floor.
- The elevator is represented by the `elv.png` image.
- Sound notification using `ding.mp3` upon elevator arrival.
- Elevator call button text changes to green when pressed and reverts to its original color upon elevator arrival.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pygame library (for graphical interface and animation)

## Installation
